## Data Analyst with R Track
### [Link course Datacamp](https://learn.datacamp.com/career-tracks/data-analyst-with-r?version=3)

In this track, I learn how to import, clean, manipulate, and visualize data in R—all integral skills for any aspiring data professional or researcher. 

Through interactive exercises, I get hands-on with `ggplot2` and `tidyverse` packages like `dplyr` and `readr`. 

Develop your data manipulation and exploratory data analysis skills by working with a wide range of real-world datasets, including everything from Australian population figures to Netflix films. 

## Introduction to the Tidyverse

Description:

- Focused on a powerful set of tools, Tidyverse.
- Learn the intertwined processes of data manipulation and visualization using the tools `dplyr` and `ggplot2`.
- Learn to manipulate data by filtering, sorting, and summarizing a real dataset of historical country data in order to answer exploratory questions.
- Learn to turn this processed data into informative line plots, bar plots, histograms, and more with the `ggplot2` package.

## Categorical Data in the Tidyverse

Description:

- Work with non-numerical data, such as job titles, survey responses, or demographic information in R, called factors, 
- Use the tidyverse package forcats including `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `stringr`, and `tidyr` 
- Use real world datasets, such as the fivethirtyeight flight dataset and Kaggle’s State of Data Science and ML Survey. 


## Data Visualization with ggplot2

Description:

- Produce meaningful and beautiful data visualizations is an essential part of your skill set as a data scientist. 
- Examine the three essential layers for making a plot - Data, Aesthetics and Geometries. 
- Visualization with Statistics and learn how Coordinates and Facets aid in communication. 
- Use  all the tools needed to make a custom plotting function to explore a large data set, combining statistics and excellent visuals.

## Data Manipulation with data.table in R

Description:

- The `data.table` package provides a high-performance version of base R's data.frame with syntax and feature enhancements for ease of use, convenience and programming speed. 
- To create, subset, and manipulate data.tables
- The database-inspired features of data.tables, including built-in groupwise operations. 
- Fast methods of importing and exporting tabular text data such as CSV files. 

## Importing Data in R

Description:

- Learn to Import data into R with different formats, ranging from .csv and text files, to statistical software files, to databases and HTML data. 
- Approach to use is key to getting started with the actual analysis. 
- Use `read .csv`, `readr` and `data.table` packages, `readxl` and `gdata` to easily and efficiently import flat file, text files, .csv, .xls files in R using.
- Import data from relational databases and how to import and work with data coming from the web or from statistical software packages such as SAS, STATA, and SPSS.
