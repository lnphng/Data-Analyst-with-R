- Learn verbs used to transform your data, including select, filter, arrange, and mutate. 
- use these functions to modify the counties dataset to view particular observations and answer questions about the data.
```{r}
library(knitr)
library(dplyr)
```


## 1. Transforming Data with `dplyr`

- Use `dplyr` to transform data, including select, filter, arrange, and mutate.

- Practise with the `counties dataset` to view particular observations and answer questions about the data.

```{r}

counties <- readRDS(url("https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4984/datasets/a924bf7063f02a5445e1f49cc1c75c78e018ac4c/counties.rds", "rb"))

glimpse(counties)

# Select the columns 
kable(head(counties %>%
  select(state,county,population,poverty),5))


  
```
### Arranging observations

- The `counties_selected` dataset with a few interesting variables selected. 
- These variables: private_work, public_work, self_employed describe whether people work for the government, for private companies, or for themselves.

```{r}

counties_selected <- counties %>%
  select(state, county, population, private_work, public_work, self_employed)

# Add a verb to sort in descending order of public_work
kable(head(counties_selected %>%
  arrange(desc(public_work)),5))

```


Filter for counties in the state of California that have a population above 1000000

        
```{r}
kable(head(counties_selected %>% 
  filter(state =="California",
        
        population > 1000000),5))
```

Filter for Texas and more than 10000 people; sort in descending order of private_work
```{r}
kable(head(counties_selected %>%
    filter(state =='Texas', population >10000) %>%
    arrange(desc(private_work)),5))
```

### Use Mutate()
Calculate proportion_women as the fraction of the population made up of women

```{r}
counties_selected <- counties %>%
                    select(state, county, population, men, women)

# Calculate proportion_women as the fraction of the population made up of women
counties_selected %>%
        mutate(proportion_women= women/population)
```

Find the counties with the highest proportion of men.

```{r}
counties %>%
  # Select the five columns 
  select(state,county,population,men,women) %>%
  # Add the proportion_men variable
  mutate(proportion_men = men/population)%>%
  # Filter for population of at least 10,000
  filter(population >10000) %>%
  # Arrange proportion of men in descending order 
  arrange(desc(proportion_men))
```

>> Sussex County in Virginia is more than two thirds male: this is because of two men's prisons in the county.

## 2. Aggregating Data

Use count to find the number of counties in each region

```{r}
counties_selected <- counties %>%
  select(region, state, population, citizens)

head(counties_selected %>%
  count(region,sort=TRUE),5)
```

Find number of counties per state, weighted by citizens
Which city has the largest total population?
```{r}
head(counties_selected %>%
  count(state, wt=citizens, sort=TRUE),5)
```
 - Table shows the population in each city and California has the largest total population.

**Which city has the largest number of people who walk to work?**

```{r}
counties_selected <- counties %>%
  select(region, state, population, walk)

counties_selected %>%
  # Add population_walk containing the total number of people who walk to work 
  mutate(population_walk = population*walk/100) %>%
  # Count weighted by the new column
  count(state, wt=population_walk, sort=TRUE  )  
```

- New York has the largest number of peope who walk to work.

**Summarize to find minimum population, maximum unemployment, and average income**

```{r}
counties_selected <- counties %>%
  select(county, population, income, unemployment)
counties_selected %>%
  summarize(min_population = min(population),
            max_unemployment = max(unemployment),
            average_income=mean(income))

```
```{r}
counties_selected <- counties %>%
  select(state, county, population, land_area)
```

**Add a density column, then sort in descending order**

```{r}
counties_selected <- counties %>%
  select(state, county, population, land_area)
# Add a density column, then sort in descending order
counties_selected %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarize(total_area = sum(land_area),
            total_population = sum(population)) %>%
            mutate(density=total_population/total_area)%>%
              arrange(desc(density))
```

- New Jersey and Rhode Island are crowed

**Calculate the average_pop and median_pop columns**
```{r}
# Calculate the average_pop and median_pop columns 
counties_selected <- counties %>%
  select(region, state, county, population)
counties_selected %>%
  group_by(region, state) %>%
  summarize(total_pop = sum(population)) %>%
  summarize(average_pop=mean(total_pop),
              median_pop = median(total_pop))
```

The South has the highest `average_pop` of 7370486, while the North Central region has the highest `median_pop` of 5580644.

**Group by region and find the greatest number of citizens who walk to work**

```{r}

counties_selected <- counties %>%
  select(region, state, county, metro, population, walk)
# Group by region and find the greatest number of citizens who walk to work
counties_selected %>%
  group_by(region)%>%
  top_n(1,walk)
  
```

**Find the highest income state in each region**

```{r}
counties_selected <- counties %>%
  select(region, state, county, population, income)
counties_selected %>%
  group_by(region, state) %>%
  # Calculate average income
  summarize(average_income=mean(income)) %>%
  # Find the highest income state in each region
  top_n(1,average_income)
```
**Count the states with more people in Metro or Nonmetro areas**

```{r}
# Count the states with more people in Metro or Nonmetro areas
counties_selected <- counties%>%
  select(region, state, metro, population)

counties_selected %>%
  group_by(state, metro) %>%
  summarize(total_pop = sum(population)) %>%
  top_n(1, total_pop) %>%
  ungroup()%>%
  count(metro)
  
```


## 3. Selecting and Transforming Data

**Select state, county, population, and industry-related columns**
```{r}
glimpse(counties)

counties %>%
  # Select state, county, population, and industry-related columns
  select(state, county, population, professional, service, office, construction, production) %>%
  
  # Arrange service in descending order 
  arrange(desc(service))
```

**Filter for counties that have at least 50% of people engaged in public work**

```{r}
counties %>%
  # Select the state, county, population, and those ending with "work"
  select(state, county, population, ends_with('work'))%>%
  # Filter for counties that have at least 50% of people engaged in public work
  filter(public_work >=50)
```

**Rename the n column to num_counties**

```{r}
# Rename the n column to num_counties
counties %>%
  count(state)%>%
  
  rename(num_counties=n)
  
```

Select state, county, and poverty as poverty_rate

```{r}
# Select state, county, and poverty as poverty_rate
counties %>%
  select(state, county, poverty_rate= poverty)
```

Using transmute()

```{r}
counties %>%
  # Keep the state, county, and populations columns, and add a density column
  transmute(state, county, population, density=population/land_area)%>%
  # Filter for counties with a population greater than one million 
  filter(population >1000000)%>%
  # Sort density in ascending order 
  arrange(density)
```

summary
```{r}
# Change the name of the unemployment column
counties %>%
  rename(unemployment_rate = unemployment)

# Keep the state and county columns, and the columns containing poverty
counties %>%
  select(state, county, contains("poverty"))

# Calculate the fraction_women column without dropping the other columns
counties %>%
  mutate(fraction_women = women / population)

# Keep only the state, county, and employment_rate columns
counties %>%
  transmute(state, county, employment_rate = employed / population)
```
